# 🎉 Welcome to My Solidity Smart Contract Project! 🎉

Hello there, welcome to my project! For this project, I have written a smart contract that implements the mint(), balanceof() and transfer() functions and use html and JavaScript for interaction with frontend.


## Description

Here I have created a real life scenario an NFT system
This project is all about creating, transferring, and checking balances of tokens on the blockchain. Here's a quick rundown:

#### Creating Tokens
Users can create their own tokens - it's as simple as calling the mint() function.



#### Checking Balances
This balanceof() will help you with knowing you balance


#### Transferring Tokens

Want to share the wealth? 😼😼 You can send tokens to any address with the transfer() function.


easy-to-use HTML interface... 👍👍
